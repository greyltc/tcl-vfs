	* Further minor improvements, unfortunately requires
	new release of Tcl from cvs (today).  Also added
	'install' target to vc++ makefile.

	* can now mount root volumes which end in separator
	characters (such as 'ftp://').  The code handles path
	separation in such cases.  This means the 'urltype'
	vfs now works (the 8-22 changes below didn't quite
	complete the job).
	This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.
	
2001-08-22  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* added ability to treat entire urls as file paths, so
	we can mount 'ftp://' as a root volume and examine its
	contents.  This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.

	* ftp vfs works reasonably well now; try:
	% package require vfs
	% vfs::ftp::Mount ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/pub/alpha/ local
	% cd local ; cd tcl ; source vfsTest.tcl
	
2001-08-10  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* added a man page vfs.n
	* added 'utime' to various vfs
	* included mk4tcl vfs implementation which works
	* added some support files so this library can be
	  used more easily with TclKit.
	* memory leak in file attributes get fixed.

	* initial distribution, zip vfs works
