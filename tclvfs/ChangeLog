2002-05-13  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/webdavvfs.tcl: v. early implementation of a webdav
	vfs.  (Note: this and the 'http' vfs need lots of work --
	please help out!).  This requires the '2.6' version of the http
	package which is distributed with tclvfs.
	
2002-05-13  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: newer version from tclkit.

2002-05-03  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/*: more test improvements, and new file vfsArchive.test
	which will test the running of the tests inside an archive. 
	This requires recursive invocation of the 'tcltest' package,
	which may well cause some problems if it isn't designed to
	handle that (i.e. executing one test actually causes the
	execution of a lot of other tests).
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: update to try to avoid the 'no such
	command vfs::*::Mount' error messages which you can get, if
	the relevant .tcl files are not on your auto_path.

2002-05-02  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/vfs.test: tests work independent of directory in which
	they run.  Tests added to check that at least 'vfs::memchan'
	basically works, and vfs::zip, vfs::crc helpers do what they
	are supposed to.
	* tests/vfsZip.test: test to run all tests inside a zip.
	* mac/*: updated for removal of scripdoc.tcl and vfs.tcl
	
2002-04-25  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* library/*vfs.tcl: switching to vfs::{crc,memchan,zip}
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: fixed env to be global, added unset
	so unmounting cleans up its list of mounted file systems,
	define Trf/memchan-based versions of vfs::{crc,memchan,zip}
	* library/{scripdoc.tcl,vfs.tcl}: removed, tclkit specific
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: drop packages "scripdoc" and "vfslib"

2002-04-25  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/*: revamp of tests to be more robust, and to be
	able to run from inside a mounted virtual filesystem.
	
2002-04-09  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* configure: generated and added to project

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>
	* mac/pkgIndex_mac.tcl: synced to generic/pkgIndex.tcl

2002-04-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* Makefile.in: compilation fix from jcw.
	
2002-03-16  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: updated for latest cvs head of Tcl 8.4a5.
	* library/vfs.tcl: New version from jcw, with better handling
	of env(PATH).

2002-03-09  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: updated version from Jean-Claude Wippler.

2002-03-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/*.tcl: completed and tested most changes from 02-19.

2002-02-19  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/*.tcl: updated the vfs implementations to deal
	with the 2002-02-01 change below.  More work needed.

2002-02-17  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: updated for TIP#72 application to cvs head.
	The 'file stat' implementation now deals with files of size
	greater than a 32 bit representation.  This requires the
	very latest cvs head of Tcl 8.4a4, and is not compatible
	with previous releases (but that is fine, since we're still
	tracking alpha releases anyway).

2002-02-01 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: allow 'pattern' to be NULL in calls to 
	Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory in preparation for fix of Tcl bug
	511666.  This will require additions to each individual
	filesystem to handle that special case (and thereby fix the
	bug that fully specified files were not matched against
	'types').

2002-01-28 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: const, MacOS fixes (also thanks Daniel Steffen).

2001-12-07 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* various test, install fixes (unix) thanks to Larry Virden.
	
2001-12-02 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: minor code cleanup and simplification. Fix
	to problem with absolute paths on unix systems introduced in
	recent changes.
	
2001-11-21 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: added more comments to the code, and 
	made mount point checking faster and simpler (we no longer
	need to modify strings temporarily).
	
2001-11-09 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/vfs*.test: better tests; more platform independent.

2001-11-08  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: made code thread-safe.  Disallow
	safe interpreters from using vfs code since they can then
	mess with the filesystem across all interpreters.

2001-11-07  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: all mount information is now stored in a
	purpose built data structure ('vfs::mount' variable is gone),
	and the code handles multiple interpreters in a very robust
	fashion.  Fixes crashing problem in pkg_mkIndex and
	general inconsistencies with multiple interps.  Also, the 
	'-volume' flag is no longer required for unmounting.  Lastly
	added a lot more documentation in the code.
	* library/vfsUrl.tcl: remove '-volume' flag.
	* tests/vfs*.test: various new tests added
	* doc/vfs.n: documentation much improved, especially with
	respect to multiple interpreters.

2001-11-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: 'vfs::mount' no longer a string-literal
	* tests/vfs*.test: various new tests added
	
2001-10-31  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* examples/simpleExamples.tcl: a demo
	* doc/vfslib.n: some documentation on the 'library' code.
	
2001-10-29  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
        * win/makefile.vc: installation is better.
	* library/vfsUrl.tcl: improved urltype mounting.  The following
	will now work in all cases:
	% vfs::urltype::Mount ftp
	% set listing [glob -dir ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub *]
	...
	% vfs::urltype::Mount http
	% set fd [open http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl]
	% set contents [read $fd] ; close $fd
	...
	
2001-09-27  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Update from Jean-Claude Wippler
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl:
	* generic/vfs.c: Moved 'list volumes' functionality
	entirely into C from Tcl (faster and easier for tclkit
	to make proper use of).  This required the addition
	of a '-volume' flag to the mount/unmount commands, and
	meant we can remove the 'mountschanged' subcommand.

2001-09-07  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: Fixed '==' error
	* doc/vfs.n: Improved docs.
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Better mk support

2001-09-06  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* Further minor improvements, unfortunately requires
	new release of Tcl from cvs (today).  Also added
	'install' target to vc++ makefile.

2001-08-29  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* can now mount root volumes which end in separator
	characters (such as 'ftp://').  The code handles path
	separation in such cases.  This means the 'urltype'
	vfs now works (the 8-22 changes below didn't quite
	complete the job).
	This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.
	
2001-08-22  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* added ability to treat entire urls as file paths, so
	we can mount 'ftp://' as a root volume and examine its
	contents.  This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.
	
2001-08-13  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* ftp vfs works reasonably well now; try:
	% package require vfs
	% vfs::ftp::Mount ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/pub/alpha/ local
	% cd local ; cd tcl ; source vfsTest.tcl
	
2001-08-10  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* added a man page vfs.n
	* added 'utime' to various vfs
	* included mk4tcl vfs implementation which works
	* added some support files so this library can be
	  used more easily with TclKit.
	* memory leak in file attributes get fixed.

2001-05-09  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* initial distribution, zip vfs works
