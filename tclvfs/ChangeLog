	* starkit.tcl: add file normalize around info nameofexe, fixes
	startup detection when exec'd in some cases (thx E Boudaillier).

2003-09-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: fix to Bug #796782.
	* library/zipvfs.tcl:
	* library/tarvfs.tcl: fix to similar bug in these filesystems.
	
2003-07-15  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* tests/vfsZip.test:
	* tests/vfsTar.test: added some new tests for recently fixed
        bugs.
        * library/tarvfs.tcl: fix to bug when closing an empty archive.

        Also updated package to version 1.2.1 since a variety of bugs
        have been fixed since the 1.2 release
	
2003-07-06  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: fix to 'file stat' on a directory, which
        fixes a variety of problems (e.g. recurisve 'file copy' in a 
        directory).  Thanks to msofer for the detailed bug report and
        test script.
	* library/zipvfs.tcl:
	* library/tarvfs.tcl: ensure archive channel is closed if an
	error is encountered while trying to open it.
	
2003-07-03  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: added support for ports other than 21,
	patch from msofer -- thanks.
	
2003-06-16  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: added '-output ::vfs::log' to ftp
        initialisation code to avoid messages being dumped to stderr
        when errors occur.
	
2003-05-16  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/tkvfs.tcl: added 'tk' widget hierarchy vfs.  Use:
	     package require vfs::tk
	     vfs::tk::Mount .frame.a.b foo
	     cd foo
	     ...
	  to examine.
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl(.in): added new package.
	
2003-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl.in: use vfs::dll var directly

2003-05-14  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: fix to package names
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: fix to 'file attributes' implementation
	
2003-04-29  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/zipvfs.tcl: patterns in 'glob' should be case-insensitive
	since everything else is.
	
2003-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to newest tcl.m4, regenerated
	  configure's.

2003-03-17  Jean-Claude Wippler  <jcw@equi4.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl, pkgIndex.tcl.in: mk4vfs rev bumped to 1.9
	* mk4vfs.tcl: reverted to old translucent/readwrite open modes

2003-03-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/vfs.man:             Added doctools documentation derived
	* doc/vfs-fsapi.man:       from the original nroff-based
	* doc/vfs-filesystems.man: manpages. Approved by Vincent.

2003-03-11  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated for Tcl's incompatible change 
	from 'd' to 'g' for debug builds.

2003-02-24  Jean-Claude Wippler  <jcw@equi4.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl, pkgIndex.tcl.in: starkit rev bumped to 1.2
	* starkit.tcl: more contexts, panic ok if "." already gone

2003-02-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure: regen
	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: regen from latest TEA setup
	* Makefile.in: only use pkgIndex.tcl with shared builds
	Handle RUNTIME_SOURCES properly when srcdir == top_builddir

2003-02-21  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* doc/vfs.n:
	* library/*.tcl: added missing 'recursive' flag to most
        .tcl 'removedirectory' implementations.
	
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: added catch around 'after cancel'
	
2003-02-21  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c: some small cleanup
	* doc/vfs.n: better documentation for 'createdirectory'
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: better posix adherence.
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: typo fix.
	
2003-02-20  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c: completed use of internalerror and posix handling
	for all functions.
	* doc/vfs.n:
	* doc/vfslib.n: more documentation regarding handling of errors
	and use of the 'internalerror' feature.
	
        Around the time Tcl 8.4.2 is released we should increment tclvfs's
	version to 1.3 and make a proper release.  In the meantime,
	improvements to all .tcl implementations (esp. proper error
	handling) would be greatly appreciated.
	
2003-02-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Switching to canceling the stored after id
	  of the periodic commit in _unmount instead of canceling by
	  script. The scripts in '_umount' and 'periodicCommit' were
	  different, causing the cancel to fail, and thus an eternal
	  commit, failing after the close; hanging the system.

2003-02-20  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c: added new debugging feature 'vfs::filesystem
	internalerror ?script?'  which can be used to specify a script to
	evaluate when any tclvfs implementation throws a standard Tcl
	error.  Once implementation of all .tcl's is complete, they
	should only return TCL_OK or a posix error code (which has a Tcl
	return value of -1).  Any other code will signal an unintended
	error which can be logged or reported using this new hook.  If
	the script is not set, the behaviour of this extension is
	unchanged.  For example:
	
        vfs::filesystem internalerror vfsreport
	proc vfsreport {} {
	    puts "vfs bug found: $::errorInfo"
	}
	
	Note that this has only been applied to those VFS api's which
	are not currently able to pass an error message at the Tcl level.
	Some (open, matchindirectory, fileattributes with get/set) are
	already able to pass their errors up, so these cases are *not*
	passed to this handler.

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: made one change to support the above
	feature.
	
2003-02-19  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: added 'commit' attribute
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl:
	* library/tarvfs.tcl:
	* library/zipvfs.tcl:
	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: added support for 'state' attribute
	of these filesystems.
	
2003-02-18  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c:
        * library/*.tcl: clean up of posix error handling.

        * doc/vfs.n: added some more documentation.
	
2003-02-18  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c: added 'vfs::filesystem posixerror' command
	to allow direct reporting of posix error codes to Tcl.
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: added support for state switching
	between "readonly", "translucent" and "readwrite".
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: 
	* library/tarvfs.tcl:
	* library/zipvfs.tcl:
	* library/httpvfs.tcl: added support for proper reporting
	of read-only status of filesystem
	* library/tclIndex:  regen.
	
        You can now switch an mk4 filesystem between translucent and
	readonly with 'vfs::attributes $mount -state readonly'. All
	errors etc are correctly reported as if the filesystem is
	read-only.
	
2003-02-17  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: added beginnings of interface for
	filesystem configuration.
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex:  regen.
	
2003-02-01  Jean-Claude Wippler  <jcw@equi4.com>

	* library/vfslib.tcl: fixed bug in new vfs::zstream code,
	preventing forward seeking from working properly
	* library/starkit.tcl: recognize if launched as NT service

2003-02-08  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* library/*.tcl: made all 'matchindirectory' implementations
	robust to whether they are passed a directory with a trailing
	file-separator or not.  (Tcl doesn't document whether there
	will be one, and optimisations to Tcl's filesystem require
	this flexibility.  Also the use of 'file join' will actually
	make the entire filesystem *more* efficient soon).
	
2003-02-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Added SC_TCL_EARLY_FLAGS and
	* configure.in:     SC_TCL64BIT_FLAGS, copied from the Tcl
	* configure:        configuration. Usage prevents mismatch
	                    between tcl core and tclvfs with regard
			    to the selected types for wide integer
			    and Tcl_StatBuf. Regenerated configure.

2003-02-04  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* doc/vfs.n: 
	* doc/vfslib.n: update docs to reflect last six months
	of changes.
	
2003-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Fixed bad vfs::mk4::Mount change.

2003-02-04  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/vfs.c: fixed version of VfsFullyNormalizePath,
	should resolve some problems with symlinks. Tcl really needs
	a 'file normalized -full' and equivalent C api.
	
2003-02-04  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* tests/*.test: cleanup
	
	Also updated version of the package to 1.2 (not 1.1 since there's
	a Windows binary floating around with that number, and we want to
	avoid confusion).  It's been fixed at 1.0 for far too long.
	
2003-02-01  Jean-Claude Wippler  <jcw@equi4.com>

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl:  fixed bad mk4vfs::_umount change

2003-02-01  Jean-Claude Wippler  <jcw@equi4.com>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl.in: mk4vfs 1.8, starkit 1.1, vfslib 1.3.1
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: (shouldn't this be dropped from CVS now?)
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl:  updated from tclkit project
	* library/starkit.tcl: updated from tclkit project
	* library/vfslib.tcl:  updated from tclkit project

2003-01-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: only install pkgIndex.tcl for shared builds

2003-01-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl.in (new):
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: Replace pkgIndex.tcl with one that is
	* configure:            generated by configure to include the right
	* configure.in:         vfs dll name.  Left the old one for
	* Makefile.in:          non-configure users, but it can be wrong.
	Also added tarvfs.tcl to list of files to install.

	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: code cleanup

2003-01-28  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/*.tcl: add 'package provide vfs::<name>' to the
	virtual filesystems.  These are the current versions:
	
	package ifneeded vfs::ftp 1.0 
	package ifneeded vfs::http 0.5
	package ifneeded vfs::mk4 1.6 
	package ifneeded vfs::ns 0.5 
	package ifneeded vfs::tar 0.9
	package ifneeded vfs::test 1.0
	package ifneeded vfs::urltype 1.0
	package ifneeded vfs::webdav 0.1
	package ifneeded vfs::zip 1.0 
	
        I've used '0.1' to indicate a very preliminary version, 0.5 for
	something which has had some work, 0.9 for nearly complete and
	1.0 or newer for something which is well used.
	
        There is no need to do 'package require vfs', simply do a package
	require of the particular vfs implementation you want from the
	above list.
	
	* DESCRIPTION.txt:
	* make55.tcl: new files for TIP55 compliance. (Steve Cassidy)

        * tests/*:
	* doc/tcllib.n: updated tests and docs for the above 'package'
	information.

2003-01-16  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/tarvfs.tcl: 
	* library/zipvfs.tcl: ::close .zip or .tar file when unmounting
	the filesystem.
	
2003-01-14  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/tarvfs.tcl: new 'tar' filesystem courtesy of Stefan
	Vogel -- many thanks!  The tar vfs is currently read-only and
	doesn't support .tgz.
	* library/tclIndex:
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: updated for new tar vfs.
	
2003-01-06  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: allow 'file mtime' to set the modified
	time of a file, if the ftp package supports it.
	
2002-12-24  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/ftpvfs.tcl: set the 'size' element in stat calls.
	(Bug reported on comp.lang.tcl).
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: added '.kit' to the set of extensions
	which vfs::auto will recognise for auto-mounting.
	
2002-10-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: Changed 'tcl_platform' to
	  '::tcl_platform'. Package index must not assume execution at
	  global level.

2002-10-19  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: merged 1.6 changes, periodic commit/flush

2002-10-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: add tclIndex to install

	* library/mk4vfs.tcl:
	* library/starkit.tcl:
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl:
	* library/vfslib.tcl:
	* library/webdavvfs.tcl: whitespace cleanup

	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: remove 8.4 alpha checks, use vfs::dll var
	to store library name.

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:
	* configure:
	* configure.in: move the CFLAGS definition into TEA_ENABLE_SHARED
	and make it pick up the env CFLAGS at configure time.

2002-09-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in:               replace the ancient build system
	* README.cygwin:             with TEA 2002 build spec.
	* aclocal.m4:
	* config.guess (removed):
	* config.sub (removed):
	* configure:
	* configure.in:
	* install-sh (removed):
	* mkIndex.tcl.in (removed):
	* mkinstalldirs (removed):
	* tcl.m4 (removed):
	* tclconfig/README.txt (new):
	* tclconfig/install-sh (new):
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4 (new):
	* generic/vfs.c: changed BUILD_Vfs to BUILD_vfs

2002-09-10  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl:	adjusted for two new packages,
	also fixed to use proper file name on unix (as shared lib)
	* library/starkit.tcl: added, new impl of scripdoc.tcl
	* library/vfslib.tcl: added back in, need by above

2002-07-18  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: ensure all mount activity is with fully
	normalized paths in which the last path element is not a link.
	Solves (together with latest cvs head changes) a problem in
	starting up a tclkit(sh) from a link.
	
2002-07-08  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: update for latest cvs head.
	* win/makefile.vc: compilation into Release and Debug
	directories as appropriate.
	
2002-06-22  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* mac/pkgIndex_mac.tcl:
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/mk4vfs.in: fix recursive file deletion, bump to 1.5

2002-05-29  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* Makefile.in: moved the definition of $(OBJEXT) up so the
	definition of vfs_OBJECTS works with more make's

2002-05-13  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/webdavvfs.tcl: v. early implementation of a webdav
	vfs.  (Note: this and the 'http' vfs need lots of work --
	please help out!).  This requires the '2.6' version of the http
	package which is distributed with tclvfs.
	
2002-05-13  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: newer version from tclkit.

2002-05-03  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/*: more test improvements, and new file vfsArchive.test
	which will test the running of the tests inside an archive. 
	This requires recursive invocation of the 'tcltest' package,
	which may well cause some problems if it isn't designed to
	handle that (i.e. executing one test actually causes the
	execution of a lot of other tests).
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: update to try to avoid the 'no such
	command vfs::*::Mount' error messages which you can get, if
	the relevant .tcl files are not on your auto_path.

2002-05-02  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/vfs.test: tests work independent of directory in which
	they run.  Tests added to check that at least 'vfs::memchan'
	basically works, and vfs::zip, vfs::crc helpers do what they
	are supposed to.
	* tests/vfsZip.test: test to run all tests inside a zip.
	* mac/*: updated for removal of scripdoc.tcl and vfs.tcl
	
2002-04-25  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* library/*vfs.tcl: switching to vfs::{crc,memchan,zip}
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl: fixed env to be global, added unset
	so unmounting cleans up its list of mounted file systems,
	define Trf/memchan-based versions of vfs::{crc,memchan,zip}
	* library/{scripdoc.tcl,vfs.tcl}: removed, tclkit specific
	* library/pkgIndex.tcl: drop packages "scripdoc" and "vfslib"

2002-04-25  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/*: revamp of tests to be more robust, and to be
	able to run from inside a mounted virtual filesystem.
	
2002-04-09  Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
	* configure: generated and added to project

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>
	* mac/pkgIndex_mac.tcl: synced to generic/pkgIndex.tcl

2002-04-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* Makefile.in: compilation fix from jcw.
	
2002-03-16  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: updated for latest cvs head of Tcl 8.4a5.
	* library/vfs.tcl: New version from jcw, with better handling
	of env(PATH).

2002-03-09  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: updated version from Jean-Claude Wippler.

2002-03-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/*.tcl: completed and tested most changes from 02-19.

2002-02-19  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/*.tcl: updated the vfs implementations to deal
	with the 2002-02-01 change below.  More work needed.

2002-02-17  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: updated for TIP#72 application to cvs head.
	The 'file stat' implementation now deals with files of size
	greater than a 32 bit representation.  This requires the
	very latest cvs head of Tcl 8.4a4, and is not compatible
	with previous releases (but that is fine, since we're still
	tracking alpha releases anyway).

2002-02-01 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: allow 'pattern' to be NULL in calls to 
	Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory in preparation for fix of Tcl bug
	511666.  This will require additions to each individual
	filesystem to handle that special case (and thereby fix the
	bug that fully specified files were not matched against
	'types').

2002-01-28 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: const, MacOS fixes (also thanks Daniel Steffen).

2001-12-07 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* various test, install fixes (unix) thanks to Larry Virden.
	
2001-12-02 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: minor code cleanup and simplification. Fix
	to problem with absolute paths on unix systems introduced in
	recent changes.
	
2001-11-21 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: added more comments to the code, and 
	made mount point checking faster and simpler (we no longer
	need to modify strings temporarily).
	
2001-11-09 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* tests/vfs*.test: better tests; more platform independent.

2001-11-08  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: made code thread-safe.  Disallow
	safe interpreters from using vfs code since they can then
	mess with the filesystem across all interpreters.

2001-11-07  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: all mount information is now stored in a
	purpose built data structure ('vfs::mount' variable is gone),
	and the code handles multiple interpreters in a very robust
	fashion.  Fixes crashing problem in pkg_mkIndex and
	general inconsistencies with multiple interps.  Also, the 
	'-volume' flag is no longer required for unmounting.  Lastly
	added a lot more documentation in the code.
	* library/vfsUrl.tcl: remove '-volume' flag.
	* tests/vfs*.test: various new tests added
	* doc/vfs.n: documentation much improved, especially with
	respect to multiple interpreters.

2001-11-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: 'vfs::mount' no longer a string-literal
	* tests/vfs*.test: various new tests added
	
2001-10-31  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* examples/simpleExamples.tcl: a demo
	* doc/vfslib.n: some documentation on the 'library' code.
	
2001-10-29  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
        * win/makefile.vc: installation is better.
	* library/vfsUrl.tcl: improved urltype mounting.  The following
	will now work in all cases:
	% vfs::urltype::Mount ftp
	% set listing [glob -dir ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub *]
	...
	% vfs::urltype::Mount http
	% set fd [open http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl]
	% set contents [read $fd] ; close $fd
	...
	
2001-09-27  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Update from Jean-Claude Wippler
	* library/vfsUtils.tcl:
	* generic/vfs.c: Moved 'list volumes' functionality
	entirely into C from Tcl (faster and easier for tclkit
	to make proper use of).  This required the addition
	of a '-volume' flag to the mount/unmount commands, and
	meant we can remove the 'mountschanged' subcommand.

2001-09-07  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* generic/vfs.c: Fixed '==' error
	* doc/vfs.n: Improved docs.
	* library/mk4vfs.tcl: Better mk support

2001-09-06  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* Further minor improvements, unfortunately requires
	new release of Tcl from cvs (today).  Also added
	'install' target to vc++ makefile.

2001-08-29  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>
	* can now mount root volumes which end in separator
	characters (such as 'ftp://').  The code handles path
	separation in such cases.  This means the 'urltype'
	vfs now works (the 8-22 changes below didn't quite
	complete the job).
	This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.

	* added ability to treat entire urls as file paths, so
	we can mount 'ftp://' as a root volume and examine its
	contents.  This requires the latest 8.4a4 release from cvs.

	* ftp vfs works reasonably well now; try:
	% package require vfs
	% vfs::ftp::Mount ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/pub/alpha/ local
	% cd local ; cd tcl ; source vfsTest.tcl

	* added a man page vfs.n
	* added 'utime' to various vfs
	* included mk4tcl vfs implementation which works
	* added some support files so this library can be
	  used more easily with TclKit.
	* memory leak in file attributes get fixed.
