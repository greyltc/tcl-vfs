The information below is completely out of date.  TEA is basically
hopeless on Windows, and I do not recommend you wasting your time
with it.  No-one seems to take any interest in fixing the millions
of problems with TEA.

There is a good old VC++ makefile in the 'win' directory, which seems to
work (I actually have to run it twice, but at least I get a .dll, which is 
more than TEA provides).

----------------------

To use cygwin for building TEA extensions, there are a couple of things
you will need to do.

1.  Make sure you have a working Visual C++ (version 5.0 or later) compiler.

2.  Download and install the free Cygnus Cywgin full tools package from
	ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/cygwin-b20/full.exe

3.  Create a directory called "C:\bin".  Copy the sh.exe
	program from the cygnus bin directory
	(C:\cygnus\cygwin-b20\H-i586-cygwin32\bin\sh.exe) to "C:\bin".
	This will allow you to run shell scripts that use the
	"#!/bin/sh" invocation.

	Create another directory called "C:\tmp".  The bash.exe program
	requires this directory for storing temporary files.

4.  Set your environment variable "MAKE_MODE" to have the value "UNIX"
	This will set up the "make" program to operate in a more sane manner.

5.  Run vcvars32.bat.  You must do this every time you wish to
	perform a build of an extension.  It is strongly recommended
	that you modify your sytem environment so that you don't have to
	run vcvars32.bat all the time.  If you look in the vcvars32.bat
	file you will see what system environment variables need to be
	set in order to make this work.

6.  If you are authoring a TEA extension, you will also want the GNU
    autoconf package.  This can be obtained from http://www.gnu.org
    Autoconf version 2.13 or later is required.
